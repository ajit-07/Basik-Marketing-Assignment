After researching different CDN offerings like cloudfare,amazon cloudfront,google CDN,etc , I selected amazon cloudfront because=>
Amazon CloudFront is a highly scalable and secure content delivery network offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has a comprehensive API and AWS-SDK for javascript that allows programmatic management of the content served by the CDN. This makes it an ideal choice for the proposed CDN strategy as it can be easily integrated with the service to perform the required actions such as creating, updating, and deleting cache.
It is known for its fast delivery of content, reliability, and global network of edge locations, which makes it a suitable choice for delivering high-bandwidth content to a wide range of users. With its integration with AWS, It also offers advanced security features such as SSL/TLS encryption, access control, and content protection.
